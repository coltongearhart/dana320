# Introduction to Quarto

- Now that we are familiar with R and RStudio, we will introduce one more concept called **Quarto**.

- Quarto is a visual editor within RStudio that allows you to **combine text and code** (and it's output) in a single document.

- **This is how we will complete all of our notes and assignments, so it will be important to be familiar with how to write .qmd files.**
