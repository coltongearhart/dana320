# Readings {.unnumbered}

## Overview

- Weekly readings and corresponding quizzes will be assigned continuously throughout the semester.

- These will correspond to the following texts:

    - SWD = Storytelling with data (Note that this is available as an audiobook on Audible as well)

    - R4DS = [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

- Further along in the semester, there may be discussion posts related to ideas from these.

## Purpose of Readings

- **Regular content in the course will focus on the tools used to carry out data visualizations**, specifically the methods and techniques to manipulate data and create visuals in Excel, Tableau and R.

- To guide the design and creation of these visuals, **the readings are where we will explore the principles of data visualization**.

- Included in these principles are:

    - The science of visual perception (how our brains process visual information);

    - How creators can optimize a data display (methods for more effective visuals);

    - How to create accurate, non-misleading displays (from a statistical and visual perspective).

## Schedule

- Below is an outline of the assigned readings and the content they cover.
