## How to Install Excel

-   Excel and all of Microsoft Office 365 Pro Plus is available **free to BSU students**.

-   Follow these [instructions](https://bsu.service-now.com/helpdesk?id=kb_article&sys_id=d94161fcdb5a3a401e8c3c8f9d961949) to download Excel if you do not already have it on your personal computer. It is also available for free on campus computers.

-   IF YOU HAVE A MAC, using Numbers (Apple's version of Excel) is not an adequate replacement. **You will need Microsoft Excel**.

## Having Trouble?

-   Please reach out to me or the [BSU Technology Help Desk](https://www.bsu.edu/about/administrativeoffices/helpdesk) as soon as possible.
