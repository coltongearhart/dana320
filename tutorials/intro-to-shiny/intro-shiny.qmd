## So what is Shiny?

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

![](images/shinys.png){width="500px"}

. . .

> Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R.

. . .

> Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.

. . .

> shinyuieditor lets us build Shiny application UIs by dragging-and-dropping. Generates clean and proper code as you build.

## Demo

> Our goal is to be able to have an interactive tool that allows our intended audience to have a deep look at the data, rather than just a single snapshot that we provide.

```{r}
#| panel: sidebar

# create title
titlePanel(title = "Shiny Iris Explorer App!")

# create vector of variable names
# -> take out the categorical variables
vars <- setdiff(names(iris), "Species")

# create dropdowns of variable names to plot
selectInput(inputId = "yvar",
            label = "Choose Y Variable",
            choices = vars)
selectInput(inputId = "xvar",
            label = "Choose X Variable",
            choices = vars,
            selected = vars[[2]])

# create checkbox to optionally color by a categorical variable
checkboxInput(inputId = "species",
              label = "Color by Species",
              value = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| panel: fill
plotOutput("plot1")
```

```{r}
#| context: server

output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
  
  # create base plot
  p1 <- ggplot() +
    theme_bw()
  
  # add points layer
  # -> conditionally colored variable -> selected via user input
  if(input$species == TRUE){
    p1 <- p1 +
      geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                     y = .data[[input$yvar]],
                     color = Species),
                 data = iris)
  }
  else{
    p1 <- p1 +
      geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                     y = .data[[input$yvar]]),
                 data = iris)
  }
  
  print(p1)
})

```

## Big picture

Shiny can be very frustrating :(

. . .

But we can make it better with a smart approach!

. . .

1. The first step is understanding the data, cleaning the data, and the story that we want to tell (i.e. which plots are worth building into a dynamic image).

-  For this lesson, we are skipping to right after this step.

. . .

2. The next step is to think about how we can hand over the control to the user without just giving them our code and telling them to manually change it.

-  We want an intuitive way for the user to explore and click through different images (i.e. the interface).

-  It's a good idea to sketch out on paper what we want the interface to look like (so what the plot should be and the different controls, and psuedocode structure, etc.).

## How Shiny works {.smaller}

Shiny uses **reactive programming** to automatically update outputs when inputs change.

. . .

> ### User interface (UI)

UI defines how your app *looks*.

- It is running java script.
- When something is clicked, it bundles peice of data (e.g. inputs) and sends it off to the server.

. . .

> ### Server

The server defines how your app *works*.

- It is then running R in the background.
- Once the server receives the inputs, it then modifies the code to include the sent inputs
- Then then reruns the code and gives it to the output object, which gets sent back to the UI where it re-renders the output object.

. . .

> ###  Reactive loop

So essentially, Shiny implements a big listening loop.

- When a user changes something, a message is sent to the server.
- And it reruns the necessary code and sends it back to update the display.

. . .

So we need to start thinking about partitioning our design process into what the user sees and how to get it with code.

## Your first Shiny app {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r} 
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ----- Load packages ----

library(shiny)

### ---- Define UI ----

ui <- fluidPage(
  "Hello, world!"
)

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
}

### ---- Run app ----

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/first-shiny-app.png){width=60%}

:::
:::

1. It calls `library(shiny)` to load the shiny package.

2. It defines the user interface, the HTML webpage that humans interact with. In this case, it’s a page containing the words “Hello, world!”.

3. It specifies the behaviour of our app by defining a server function. It’s currently empty, so our app doesn’t do anything, but we’ll be back to revisit this shortly.

4. It executes `shinyApp(ui, server)` to construct and start a Shiny application from UI and server.

## Adding UI controls {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true

### ----- Load packages ----

library(tidyverse)

### ---- Define UI ----

# create vector of variable names
# -> take out the categorical variables

    # create dropdowns of variable names to plot
    selectInput(inputId = "yvar",
                label = "Choose Y Variable",
                choices = vars),
    selectInput(inputId = "xvar",
                label = "Choose X Variable",
                choices = vars,
                selected = vars[[2]]),
      
    # create checkbox to optionally color by a categorical variable
    checkboxInput(inputId = "species",
                  label = "Color by Species",
                  value = TRUE)
  ),
  
  # create spot for plot
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput(outputId = "plot1")
  )
)

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
}

### ---- Run app ----

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-ui-only.png){width=60%}

:::
:::

`fluidPage()` is one way to show the UI.

-  It is a **layout function** that sets up the basic visual structure of the page. The left hand side is where the sidebar / controls go and output goes on the right.

-  `fluidPage()` is a big nested function. So all of the arguments need to be separated by commas.

`selectInput()` is an **input control** that lets the user interact with the app by providing a value.

- Other input controls (widgets) and their code can be hound here: <https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/widgets/widget-gallery/>.

`mainPanel()` creates a placeholder for a plot. To actually render a plot that we have made, we need to add code to create the plot in server function.

## Adding content {.smaller}

> ### Good strategy: Part 1

First we can put in the static plot that we made to make sure that it worked.

Replace your empty `server` function with the following code:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # create static plot
  output$plot1 <- renderPlot(
    ggplot() +
      geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Width,
                     y = Sepal.Length),
                 data = iris) +
      theme_bw()
  )
  
}

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-server-static.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

Because of the reactive programming, `server <- function(input, output){}` is where we tell Shiny *how* to perform a computation (rather than ordering Shiny to actually go do it).

- So we are essentially telling Shiny how to fill in the plot outputs in the app by providing the "recipes" for those outputs.

The left-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`), `output$ID`, indicates that you’re providing the recipe for the Shiny output with that ID.

The right-hand side of the assignment uses a specific render function to wrap some code that you provide.

- Each `render{Type}` function is designed to produce a particular type of output (e.g. text, tables, and plots), and is often paired with a `{type}Output` function.

- For example, in this app, `renderPlot()` is paired with `plotOutput()` to display a plot.

## Adding behavior {.smaller}

When we change an X variable in the UI, the plot didn't change because the variable names were hardcoded and there were no connections to facilitate the change.

> ### Good strategy: Part 2

We can continue our Shiny app development by incorporating the user input.

Modify your `server` function to the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {

  # create dynamic plot
  # -> variables selected based on user input
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                   y = .data[[input$yvar]]),
               data = iris) +
    theme_bw()

}

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-server-variables.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

`input$ID` is part of the bundled input data sent from the UI.

- `input$xvar` and `input$yvar` specifically return character vectors of the results of the dropdowns, which have variable names.

To correctly map the character vector to the `aes()` statement in a `ggplot()` call, we need to use the `.data[[col]]` pronoun for it to correctly work.

## Adding behavior {.smaller}

Last feature: To get the checkbox to work, we need a conditional statement.

- So we have to build our plot in stages.

Modify your `server` function to the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {

  # create base plot
  p1 <- ggplot() + 
    theme_bw()
  
  # add points layer
  # -> conditionally colored variable -> selected via user input
  if(input$species == TRUE){
    p1 <- p1 +
      geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                     y = .data[[input$yvar]],
                     color = Species),
                data = iris)
  }else{
    p1 <- p1 +
      geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                     y = .data[[input$yvar]]),
      data = iris)
  }
  
  print(p1)

}

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-server-color.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

`input$ID` from a `checkboxInput()` returns a `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

- Starting with the base plot, we can conditionally add more layers, one of which will have another `aes()` statement and the other will not.

- Then we display the final built plot.

Thus we have a working version of the Iris explorer app!

## Furthering app design {.smaller}

> ### Another way to test app

1. Sketch the blueprint of the app.

2. Try to use code to make the static visualization that we want.

3. Then act like Shiny and create an input list, in essence simulating the user input.

- We can then modify the above code to change based on different values of the input list.
- Then just tinker with different values to make sure it works and then can put code into app when satisfied that it works.

> ### Input list

The input list is just a flexible grouping of data objects (can have nested objects and many different objects).

- Recall lists are just unspecific structure of data, while dataframes are just a group of data in a very specific format).

How the input list works:

- When the user clicks something, in the background the javascript throws the new data into the input list and passes it along.

> ### Software design principles

Whenever we hand over a software to users, there are more things that we have to consider so that they have a seamless experience using it

- Examples include:

- Renaming variables so that users see intuitive names, but still allowing R access to the variable names
- Conditional dropdowns (based on other dropdowns) so users can only create plots that make sense.

## Polishing app {.smaller}

> ### Labels

Goal is to translate variable values to the labels.

- The solution is named vectors, where the names are just referencing tools that are displayed to the user instead of the actual value.

- To do this, we just need to define our named vector, say `vars`, outside of `server`, then use the `choices = vars` argument of `selectInput`.

- These nice labels can then be accessed for axes titles by subsetting the `vars` vector to the one that is selected and pulling the name: `names(vars[vars == input$xvar])`.

Modify just the `vars` statement before the `ui` and the `server` function to the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define UI ----

# create named vector for mapping of labels to variable names
vars <- c("Sepal Length (cm)" = "Sepal.Length",
          "Sepal Width (cm)" = "Sepal.Width",
          "Petal Length (cm)" = "Petal.Length",
          "Petal Width (cm)" = "Petal.Width")

# < ... same previous UI code ... >

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$plot1 <- renderPlot({  
  
    # build points layer
    # -> conditionally colored variable -> selected via user input
    if(input$species == TRUE){
      p1 <- ggplot() +
        geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                     y = .data[[input$yvar]],
                     color = Species),
                 data = iris)
    }else{
      p1 <- ggplot() +
        geom_point(aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]],
                       y = .data[[input$yvar]]),
                   data = iris)
    }
    
    # add nice labels and theme
    p1 <- p1 + 
      labs(x = names(vars)[vars == input$xvar],
           y = names(vars)[vars == input$yvar]) + 
      theme_bw()
    
    print(p1)
    
  })
}

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-polish-names.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

## Polishing app {.smaller}

> ### Conditional dropdowns

Goal: Options for one input (independent X) depend on the value of the other input (response Y).

Logic: To do this we have to update the input after the Y variable is selected.

- After the inputs are created like normal, the server has to do all of the thinking in order for it to update actively.

Add just the following to the `server` function to the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {

  # updated dropdown
  observeEvent(input$yvar, {
    updateSelectInput(inputId = "xvar", choices = vars[vars != input$yvar])
  })
  
  # < ... same output$plot1 code as before ... >

}
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-polish-dropdown.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

1. Create the inputs like normal in the UI (same code as before).

2. In the server above the `output$plot1`, use the combo of `observeEvent(input$ID, {update{Type}Input()}` to modify the parameters of input controls, which is triggered by a change in `input$ID`.

- Then within `update{Type}Input()`, the choices of X should be indexed on not equaling the Y choice: `choices = vars[vars != input$yvar]`. In essence, we make it conditionally update based on Y.

## Polishing app

> ### What else is possible?

`conditionalPanel()` in the UI allows you to create a panel that is visible or not, depending on the value of an expression.

- This can be useful when you don't want something to show up until the user selects something.

`uiOutput()` and `renderUI()` pair allows you to create UI with code.

- This is useful when you need to create different types or numbers of inputs (or outputs), depending on other inputs (dynamically generated UI).

- This technique gives you the ability to create and modify the user interface while the app is running (not just at the start like we have been doing).

Creating an arbitrary number of or type of controls.

- For example, creating a control for each column of a general dataset.

- This involves functional programming functions from the `purrr` package, which we have not covered (but something to learn in the future!).
## Plotly in Shiny -- UI {.smaller}

Now let's add to our app to demonstrate more UI features and how to introduce `plotly` into our Shiny app.

Replace the beginning of the code in your app with the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ----- Load packages ----

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

### ---- Define UI ----

# create named vector for mapping of labels to variable names
vars <- c("Sepal Length (cm)" = "Sepal.Length",
          "Sepal Width (cm)" = "Sepal.Width",
          "Petal Length (cm)" = "Petal.Length",
          "Petal Width (cm)" = "Petal.Width")

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  titlePanel(title = "Shiny Iris Explorer App!"),
  
  sidebarPanel(
  
    # create dropdowns of variable names to plot
    selectInput(inputId = "yvar",
                label = "Choose Y Variable",
                choices = vars),
    selectInput(inputId = "xvar",
                label = "Choose X Variable",
                choices = vars,
                selected = vars[[2]]),

    # create checkbox to optionally color by a categorical variable
    checkboxInput(inputId = "species",
                  label = "Color by Species",
                  value = TRUE)
  ),
  
  # create tabs with spots for plots
  mainPanel(
    tabsetPanel(
      tabPanel(title = "ggplot",
               plotOutput(outputId = "plot1")),
      tabPanel(title = "plotly",
               plotlyOutput(outputId = "plot2"))
    )
  )
)

```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-plotly-ui.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

Make sure to load the new package at the top: `library(plotly)`.

`tabsetPanel()` and `tabPanel()` combo is the easiest way to break a page into pieces.

- `tabsetPanel()` creates a container for any number of `tabPanels()`, which can be titled and include any output that would have gone in `mainPanel()` by itself.

We will do this to include two different plots:

- One regular plot like before with `plotOutput()` and another that we will make with plotly; so, we need to have a different output container `plotlyOutput()`.

## Plotly in Shiny -- Server {.smaller}
 
 Now within the `server` function, we just need to add the new `output$plot2`.
 
 Add the following code below `output$plot1` in the `server` function:
 
:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # < ... update dropdown code .... >
  
  # < ... output$plot1 code ... >
  
  output$plot2 <- renderPlotly({

    # build base plot
    p2 <- iris %>%
      plot_ly()

    # build points layer with plotly
    # -> conditionally colored variable -> selected via user input
    if(input$species == TRUE){
      p2 <- p2 %>%
        add_markers(x = ~Petal.Width,
                    y = ~Petal.Length,
                    color = ~Species)
    }else{
      p2 <- p2 %>%
        add_markers(x = ~Petal.Width,
                    y = ~Petal.Length,
                    color = I("black")) %>% 
        hide_legend()
    }

    print(p2)

  })
}
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-plotly-server-static.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

This plotly version has a similar flow to the `ggplot` version.

- We again build the plot in stages, first just setting up the `plot_ly()` with the data.

- Then conditionally adding markers based on colored or not.

- To make sure it works, first we will hardcode in the variable names `Petal.Width` and `Petal.Length` and specify to color by `Species` or a constant `I("black")` based on the condition.

## Plotly in Shiny -- Server {.smaller}

Now to get dynamic variable selection, we need to use the following technique.

Change your `output$plot2` code to the following:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

### ---- Define server ----

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # < ... update dropdown code .... >
  
  # < ... output$plot1 code ... >
  
  output$plot2 <- renderPlotly({

    # build base plot
    p2 <- iris %>%
      plot_ly()

    # build points layer with plotly
    # -> conditionally colored variable -> selected via user input
    if(input$species == TRUE){
      p2 <- p2 %>%
        add_markers(x = paste0("~", input$xvar) %>% as.formula,
                    y = paste0("~", input$yvar) %>% as.formula,
                    color = ~Species)
    }else{
      p2 <- p2 %>%
        add_markers(x = paste0("~", input$xvar) %>% as.formula,
                    y = paste0("~", input$yvar) %>% as.formula,
                    color = I("black")) %>% 
        hide_legend()
    }

    print(p2)

  })
}
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/iris-explorer-app-plotly-server-dynamic.png){width=80%}

:::
:::

It was easy to just get a "static" plotly (i.e. with set variables)

- In `ggplot`, we just needed to use `aes(x = .data[[input$xvar]])` for exaple because `input$xvar` returns a string. 

For plotly, this argument needs to be a formula.

- So we can use `x = paste0("~", input$xvar) %>% as.formula`, for example (it could also be nested `x = as.formula(paste0("~", input$xvar))`).

## Additional Shiny features {.smaller}

:::: columns
::: {.column width="46%"}

UI 

- So far we have only worked with some simple layout structures.

- Now that we have the basics of how to program the UI, we could use more complex layouts and incorporate more features into our app at once.

- The diagrams to the right show some of the possible functions and the structures they create.

Server

- On the server side, there is one very important element that we haven't covered: **reactive programming**.

- So far, Shiny updates (i.e. sends bundles of data to the server, runs the necessary code, and returns the appropriate output), whenever the user changes an input.

- With reactive expressions, we can control *when* Shiny evaluated things.

- This is a useful strategy to reduce the amount of duplicated code (i.e. resuing calculations) and making apps much more efficient (only what needs recalculated is recalculated).

## Big picture revisisted {.smaller}

Very important points!!

- When making an app, you should come up with the STORY (narrative) FIRST, and then make the plots to show that.

- Don't make the plots first, then figure out a story!

Here is the recommended flow of a full analysis:

1. Data cleaning and organizing.

2. EDA.

3. Start with STATIC plots.

4. Then see if intertactivity aids the story.

5. Figure out how to incorporate user input.

6. Organize the "dashboard" with a sketch.

7. Incorporate UI features.

8. Add server behavior.

9. Communicate!

COMMUNICATION IS SUPER IMPORTANT!

- Being able to work with the data is important, but almost more important is to be able to communicate with both experts and lay people

- If we have a big solutions to a big problem, it is unlikely that our solo efforts will be able to fix it.

- We need to be able to make our solution understandable and be able to communicate it easily.

## Alternative approach to building applications

As data scientists, we want our time and effort to be spent on actually doing good data science (working with the data, transforming data, creating insightful plots, telling stories) rather than things like formatting the UI.

## Installing the necessary packages

Run the following lines of code to install the packages we need:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

install.packages("devtools") # needed for the following function
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinyuieditor")

```

## Shiny UI editor

Now lets recreate the Iris Explorer App using shinyuieditor.

Lets start a new R script with the following code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(shinyuieditor)

# !! setwd() to current location first

launch_editor(app_loc = "iris-explorer-2")

```

Now go back and forth between the `app.R` file and the shinyuieditor, borrowing code from the previous iris explorer app when needed.

### ----- Load packages ----

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

### ---- Define UI ----

# create named vector for mapping of labels to variable names
vars <- c("Sepal Length (cm)" = "Sepal.Length",
          "Sepal Width (cm)" = "Sepal.Width",
          "Petal Length (cm)" = "Petal.Length",
          "Petal Width (cm)" = "Petal.Width")

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  titlePanel(title = "Shiny Iris Explorer App!"),
  
  sidebarPanel(
  
    # create dropdowns of variable names to plot
    selectInput(inputId = "yvar",
                label = "Choose Y Variable",
                choices = vars),
    selectInput(inputId = "xvar",
                label = "Choose X Variable",
                choices = vars,
                selected = vars[[2]]),

    # create checkbox to optionally color by a categorical variable
    checkboxInput(inputId = "species",
                  label = "Color by Species",
                  value = TRUE)
  ),
  
  # create tabs with spots for plots
  mainPanel(
    tabsetPanel(
      tabPanel(title = "ggplot",
               plotOutput(outputId = "plot1")),
      tabPanel(title = "plotly",
               plotlyOutput(outputId = "plot2"))
    )
  )
)

```

Uses:

- `fluidPage()`, `sidebarPanel()`, `mainPanel()` and `tabsetPanel()` to define the structure of the page(s).

          plotlyOutput(outputId = "plot2")
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

```

Uses:

- Functions from `gridlayout` and `bslib` packages to define the structure of the page(s). These include `grid_page()`, `grid_card()`, etc.

## Comparison of methods {.smaller}

> ### Commonalities

`server`s are the EXACT SAME in both methods.

Both use:

- `{Type}Output()` functions.
- `{Type}Input()` functions.

> ### Strategy

- Let `shinyuieditor` do the heavy lifting for the UI (e.g. tasks like adding defining the structure of the page, adding input controls, specifying where plots go, etc.) and step into the code when necessary for fine tuning.

    - We don't have to worry about how it does this, just need to know how to modify what we need.

- Code the `server` function as we normally would and easily add it to our app!
