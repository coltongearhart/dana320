## Course: Introduction to Tableau

![](images/logo-tableau.png){fig-align="left"}

-   This course covers the basics of Tableau and introduces you to tools we will build on to create effective data visualizations. **This is a new software to all of us, so it is especially important to spend the time familiarizing yourself with the platform**.

-   This will serve as both content and an assignment to start the module.

-   It has 4 chapters that you will need to complete:

    1.  Getting Started with Tableau

    2.  Building and Customizing Visualizations

    3.  Digging Deeper

    4.  Presenting Your Data

-   HOW TO WORK THROUGH THIS COURSE

    -   Reminder that this course **will be the most effective if you follow along with the videos and do them at the same time and take the time to actually do the exercises**. Guessing just to get it done is not an effective learning strategy.

-   I **highly recommend** downloading and opening the workbooks in Tableau on your personal computer rather than using Tableau Public within DataCamp. This will be more beneficial in getting you familiar with the platform you will be using.
