-   Below are some steps to get R and RStudio installed on your computer and a quick video to get you familiar with the RStudio environment.

## R vs RStudio

-   R is the actual software that works behind the scenes on everything that we will do. However, it is not very user friendly; it only has a command line interface.

-   So instead, we will work in RStudio. RStudio is a IDE (integrated development environment) for R. Think of it as an application that we can use to manage and run R code.
